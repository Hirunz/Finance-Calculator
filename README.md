# Finance-Calculator
Finance calculator using java and javafx without using scene builder.

This is an assignment given to me by my university. 
This java application has four calculators --> loan, fd, morgage, savings
It also has history option which saves within the program as a txt file. 
The whole GUI part is done without using scene builder or any kind of xml.
